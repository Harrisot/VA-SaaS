### VA Microconsulting to Accelerate Product Development (MAPD)

Microconsulting is an innovative procurement method being used across government to provide immediate, high-impact support from the private sector to address a problems and opportunities that don’t require a full-blown (large) engagement!

As VA OIT continues to modernize how we develop digital products, we encourage everyone at VA to take advantage of microconsulting to accelerate digital product development.

#### What is MAPD?

MAPD is microconsulting program to help modernize and accelerate digital product development and delivery at VA. It’s available to everyone at VA. The threshold is $10,000 and you must clearly define your work products. (Note: This program is not intended to purchase office supplies, pay for conferences, pay for application upgrades, or circumvent other standard government purchasing processes.)

The goal of MAPDis to accelerate “shipping a digital thing” that is high quality, easy to use, and in compliance with VA’s digital standards! Transparency is also a goal; therefore all work statements and deliverables are posted in the GitHub microconsulting repository.

MAPD deliverables should not be traditional waterfall documents, PowerPoint presentations, and meetings.
