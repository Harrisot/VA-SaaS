# To Do

- Need to ensure common understanding of SaaS security assessment, FedRamp, and SaaS ATO processes and requirements among:
  - IT Cloud Security Team
  - EPMO I&A
  - Project Special Forces
  - VA CTO team
  
  
 
- IT Cloud Security Team (Royce, Mike C., Gio) to provide the following for "SaaS Security Assessment"
  - templates that users can fill out
  - what systems will be used--Risk Vision? (ideally not word documents that are emailed)
  - what is output format for this assessment (document?)
  - how long does an assessment take?
  - what are the steps in assessment?
  - how does this relate to ATO (it is an input?)
  - clarify VA requirement on FedRamp and/or ATO
  
- EMPO I&A Team (Ruchika's team)
  - provide any SaaS-specific information on ATO (see FedRamp note above)
  - is the ATO process exactly the same for SaaS as other COTS/custom systems?
    
- CTO (Angela)
  - confirm common understanding of SaaS Security Assessment, FedRamp, and ATO process and requirements per notes above
